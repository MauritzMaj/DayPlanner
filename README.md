## Description

For this assignment I created a day planner which allows the user to write in events and save them, per
hour block, from 9am to 5pm.

## Usage

To save the event, the user clicks the floppy disk icon.
This commits the event to localstorage, so it stays on the planner until overridden.

The colors of the planner change throughout the day, based on the current time. 

    - Past hours are indicated in grey
    - Present hour is indicated in red
    - Future hours are indicated in green

The date on top of the planner changes to reflect the current date.

See screenshot of application below:
